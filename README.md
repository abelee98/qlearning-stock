# Q-Learning for Stock Trading
A school final project for CS182: Artificial Intelligence. We used q-learning to determine whether to buy or sell a stock. 
We trained our model on a stock's 5 year historical data in order to predict the most optimal action at
the current moment.

To run, type "python main.py" and enter the stock ticker of your choice.
